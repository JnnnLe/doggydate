# doggydate
A MERN (Built in *M*ongoDB, *E*xpress.js, *R*eact.js, and *N*ode) stack application where to-be doggy parent(s) can browse dogs for adoption ðŸ’• I am a doggy mom myself and *big* advocate for senior dog adoptions, but more importantly, I am an advocate for finding homes for as many animals as possible.


## Installation 
Use the package managers [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/). In this example I used yarn. __Note__: You will need to open **two terminal windows** to run this application, one for the server and one for the CRA (Create react app). <br>

Installing dependencies <br>
Back-end: 
  ``` yarn install ```

  Start server and establish connection to MongoDB, ignore depreciation warning in console.
  ``` cd server ```
  ```yarn restart ``` 

Front-end:
  ```cd client```

  Install your client side dependencies
  ```yarn install``

  Start your frontend server
  ```yarn start```
