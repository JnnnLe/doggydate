# doggydate
A MERN (Built in *M*ongoDB, *E*xpress.js, *R*eact.js, and *N*ode) stack application where to-be doggy parent(s) can browse dogs for adoption ðŸ’• I am a doggy mom myself and *big* advocate for senior dog adoptions, but more importantly, I am an advocate for finding homes for as many animals as possible.
